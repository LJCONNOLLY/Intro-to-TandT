  <h1 class="hero">Hi! I'm LJ Connolly!</h1>

  <p class="lead">As both a student and educator, I bring a unique dual perspective to creating digital innovations that enhance learning, drawing on my research insights and classroom experience to develop tools and approaches that truly serve students. As someone immersed in the interdisciplinary field of Texts and Technology, I've developed a keen ability to demystify complex ideas, fostering understanding through inclusive discussions, meaningful feedback, and responsive support that honors each student's unique learning journey. My curriculum development draws from digital humanities, critical technology studies, and emerging media. I'm passionate about exploring where text, technology, and teaching intersect, and I'm committed to building interactive classrooms that foster student growth, digital literacy, and academic success.</p>
