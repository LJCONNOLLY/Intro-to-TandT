## LJ Connolly | UX Researcher

I'm driven by understanding how people interact with digital tools and making complex information accessible for diverse audiences. 

As a PhD student in the Texts and Technology program at the University of Central Florida, digital humanities and critical technology studies shape how I approach user research 

My background in editing and writing strengthens my ability to translate complex research into clear, accessible, and actionable insights, and my background in Women's and Gender Studies means I'm always considering whose voices are left out of the conversation and how to center marginalized perspectives in my work. 

Whether I'm examining LGBTQ+ users' pain points on dating apps or exploring how citizens of a small town perceive the monuments in their community, I bring rigorous research methodology to every projectâ€”designing studies, conducting in-depth interviews, and synthesizing complex data into clear narratives that lead to meaningful change.
