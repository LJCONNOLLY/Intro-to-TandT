# Hey! I'm LJ. 

# Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm a UX researcher because I believe in centering the voices that too often get overlookedâ€”and I'm passionate about making human-centered research more accessible and engaging for everyone involved.

My path here was shaped by my sociological training in Women's and Gender Studies, where I learned to always ask: whose experiences are we centering, and whose are we missing? Now, as a PhD student in the Texts and Technology program at the University of Central Florida, I bring that critical lens to every project, combining digital humanities and critical technology studies with human-centered UX methods.

I design research that centers marginalized perspectives and ensures that decisions are informed by diverse user experiences, not assumptions.

My background in editing and writing helps me translate complex research into clear, actionable insights that drive change. Whether I'm exploring LGBTQ+ users' experiences on dating apps or investigating how communities connect with public monuments, I bring the same approach: rigorous human-centered methods, deep listening through in-depth interviews, and a commitment to synthesizing data into compelling narratives that lead to meaningful impact.

Outside of research, you'll find me in my cottage in downtown Lakeland, Florida with my wife, our five cats, our betta fish, Blueberry, and enough plants to qualify as a small botanical garden.
