### Pedagogical Philosophy
My approach to teaching writing emphasizes *process over product* and *curiosity over compliance.* I encourage students to think critically about technology’s role in literacy, authorship, and access. Whether working with essays, podcasts, or infographics, I aim to help students develop adaptable communication skills for both academic and professional contexts.
